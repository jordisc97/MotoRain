## Overview
iOS mobile application that automatically checks for rain conditions during your commute hours and sends push notifications.

## Features
- ‚è∞ **Commute Schedule**: Configure work days and commute hours
- üåßÔ∏è **Automatic Rain Checks**: Background checks before commute times
- üì± **Push Notifications**: Green tick (no rain) or red alert (rain expected)
- üè† **Location Management**: Set home and work addresses
- üîÑ **Background Sync**: Integrates with existing MotoRain backend API

## Architecture

### Frontend (iOS App)
- **Framework**: React Native or Swift
- **State Management**: Redux/Context API or SwiftUI
- **Background Tasks**: iOS Background App Refresh
- **Push Notifications**: Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)
- **Location Services**: Core Location framework

### Backend Integration
- **API Endpoint**: `http://your-backend-url:8000/check_rain/`
- **Scheduling Service**: iOS Background Processing
- **Data Storage**: Core Data or SQLite for user settings
